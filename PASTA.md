HI! Today we will be making "WHITE SAUCE PASTA"

The first step is to boil the pasta,for making it soft add some oil and salt while boiling.
(how to know if the pasta is boiled? --- take a spoon and try cutting one of the macronis and if its easy to cut its done and if not , let it bol for some more minutes.NOTE:keep checking this or else it will be overcooked!)
strain it after its done.

For white sauce sauce :
take some butter and add to the pan,after it gets heated add a very generous amount of maida into it.
now take a spatula and mix them slowly on low flame after its color changes to golden-brown.
